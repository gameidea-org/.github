# About
[gameidea](https://gameidea.org/) aims to provide free resources to anyone for their game development work. It includes tutorials, discussions, assets & so on. The main focus is to discuss shaders, algorithms & techniques used in game development. However, it is not strictly confined to video games.

# Team
I am Mujtaba & I solely manage game idea. I study software engineering at COMSATS & the website was created as part of my digital marketing course. However, I decided to keep the website even after the semester ends & to work on it.
